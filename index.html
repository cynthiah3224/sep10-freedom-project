      <h4>3D Printing Homes</h4>
      <h6 class=center>Now a days there is a lot of 3D printing. with the new tech that we have and sponsors from tech companies we are able to help these people. The Idea would be to 3D print a big building filled with apartments and let homeless people use them for 3-6 months until they are stable enough to leave and live on their own.</h6>
      
      
      
      <h4>Homeless Website</h4>
      <h6 class=center>Making this website can help so many people and it is more realistical for a highschooler like me. This website is getting donations from random people and putting everything into food, housing, and clothing. After we have a good amount we distribute everythin out of the puerness of our hearts. I want to show that their is still humanity in people.</h6>
        
        
        
      <h4>Booths</h4>  
      <h6 class=center>These Pods are areas where homeless people can go and call someone they know. Call the police if necessary. With no additional cost they are able to make those phone calls. For their own safety and other people too. Civilians around the area should feel safe and they should be able to call someone in case of an emergency. </h6>  

      
      
      <h4>Pods</h4>
      <h6>An idea where in specific areas in the city where all homeless people go to stay in a nice cozy area to sleep and eat something. It ends up involving a lot of technology because it's like a tent just 100x more better because this specific pod is designated to that specific person for an amount of time until the next person comes up. </h6>
